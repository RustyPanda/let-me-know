# Let Me Know

Parents waiting for NHS paedeatric appointments don't know how long they'll be waiting.

Let Me Know is a mobile-friendly website keeping parents up-to-date on waiting times.

Let Me Know also shows which doctor you'll see and asks for appointment feedback afterwards.

Created by Mike Walmsley as a product demo for Innovation Form Paediatric Hackathon.
